## Introduction
Ada Lovelace has been called the first computer programmer. Her name has recently perhaps gotten a wider attention since NVIDA named a GPU architecture after her, and of course the programming language (ADA) is named after her. She was the daughter of Lord Byron, the famous poet.

Byron was a very controversial figure in his time, and he was a leading figure in the Romantic movement.
Maybe the first time I heard of Byron was from the execellent movie "Dead Poets Society" when the teacher John Keating (played by Robin Williams) mockingly says "well I like Byron, I give him a 42, but I can't dance to him!". Later on in the movie one of the students reads a poem by Byron; "She walks in beauty, like the night".
