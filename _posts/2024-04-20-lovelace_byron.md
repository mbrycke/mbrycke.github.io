## Introduction
Ada Lovelace has been called the first computer programmer. Her name has recently perhaps gotten a wider attention since NVIDA named a GPU architecture after her, and of course the programming language (ADA) is named after her. She was the daughter of Lord Byron, the famous poet.

>Ada Lovelace was born in 1815, and was a mathematician and writer. She is best known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is now considered to be the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine. Because of this, she is often referred to as the first computer programmer.

>Lord Byron was born in 1788. He is considered one of the greatest British poets and maybe best known for his narrative poems "Childe Harold's Pilgrimage" and "Don Juan". He is also quite famous for swimming the Hellespont in an attempt to recreate the legendary swim by Leander.

Byron was a very controversial figure in his time, and he was a leading figure in the Romantic movement.
Maybe the first time I heard of Byron was from the execellent movie "Dead Poets Society" when the teacher John Keating (played by Robin Williams) mockingly says "well I like Byron, I give him a 42, but I can't dance to him!". Later on in the movie one of the students reads a poem by Byron:
<br>

*She walks in beauty, like the night*<br>
*Of cloudless climes and starry skies;*<br>
*And all that's best of dark and bright*<br>
*Meet in her aspect and her eyes;*<br>
*Thus mellowed to that tender light*<br>
*Which heaven to gaudy day denies.*<br>
