## Introduction

PostgreSQL can be used as a vector database by using the pgvector extension.
In fact, this vector database compare well with popular vector databases. E.g. Chroma might arguably be easier to setup and interface but postgresql with pgvector is more performant, especially for large datasets. 

## Running PostgreSQL with pgvector in docker
Create a docker file with the following content:

```dockerfile
FROM postgres:latest # use the latest postgres image as base

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \ 
    git \
    postgresql-server-dev-all \ # install the postgresql server dev tools
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* # remove the apt cache

# clone and install the pgvector extension
RUN cd /tmp \ # change to the tmp directory
    && git clone https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector.git \ # clone the pgvector repository into the tmp directory
    && cd pgvector && make install # change to the pgvector directory and install the extension
```

## Alternative 1 - Building the docker image and running the container manually
Now, we could build the docker image with the following command 

```shell
docker build -t postgres-pgvector . # build the docker image with the tag postgres-pgvector 
```
and run the docker container with the following command (setting username, password and volume)

```shell
docker run --name pgvector -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d -p 5432:5432 -v /my/local/path:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres-pgvector # run the docker container with the name pgvector, password mysecretpassword, port 5432, volume /my/local/path and the image postgres-pgvector
```

## Alternative 2 - Using docker compose
An alternative to running the container manually is to use docker-compose.

```yaml
version: '3.1' # use version 3.1 of docker-compose

services: # define the services
  postgres: # define the postgres service
    image: postgres-pgvector # use the postgres-pgvector image
    environment: # set the environment variables
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres # set the user.
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: mysecretpassword # set the password
      POSTGRES_DB: mydb # set the database. This is optional
    ports:
      - "5432:5432" # map the port 5432 to the host. 
    volumes: # set the volumes
      - /my/local/path:/var/lib/postgresql/data # map the volume /my/local/path to /var/lib/postgresql/data
      - ./init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql # map the init.sql file to the docker-entrypoint-initdb.d directory
    restart: unless-stoped # This is optional. It will restart the container unless it is stopped
```
Notice that we map the init.sql file to the docker-entrypoint-initdb.d directory. This is a directory that postgres will run when the container starts. This is useful for running initialization scripts.

**Before we run `docker compose up`** We need to create the init.sql file referred above with the following content:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pgvector; # create the pgvector extension
```
and place it in the same directory as the docker-compose file.

Now we can start the container with the following command:

```shell
docker compose up -d # start the container in detached mode
```

## Running postgres with pgvector togehter with other services

We can run the postgres container with pgvector together with other services, like a web server or an ubuntu container. We can do this again by using docker-compose. Here is an example of a docker compose file that runs a postgres container with e.g. a web server 

```yaml
version '3.1'
services:
  web:
    build:
      context: ./web
      dockerfile: Dockerfile # place the Dockerfile for the web service in the web directory
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - ./web:/code
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    restart: unless-stoped
  postgres:
    build:
      context: ./postgres
      dockerfile: Dockerfile # place the Dockerfile for the postgres service in the postgres directory

    environment: # set the environment variables
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres # set the user.
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: mysecretpassword # set the password
      POSTGRES_DB: mydb # set the database. This is optional
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    volumes:
      - /my/local/path:/var/lib/postgresql/data
      - ./init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init.sql
    restart: unless-stoped
```
