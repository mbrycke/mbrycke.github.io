## Intro
Much of the book is about Dante going to the afterlife and meeting a whole lot of people. While doing so, he makes many political commentaries. Which people does Dante meet? Most of the people many of us have never heard of, not even scholars, while others are famous still in our time. But one requirement is that the person has died before 1300. Besides that, there seems to be no restrictions, even fictional characters appear, like Aeneas from Virgil.

It is important, in order to understand the poem, to become a bit familiar with the characters who are contemporary with Dante who lived in Florence or thereabouts (but of course, have passed away). These characters are for the most part quite unknow today but would have been well known at the time.

When Dante wants to talk about politics and life in Florence, he mostly cannot use politicians and other famous people since he started writing the poem when he was 35 years old and therefore hasn't "outlived" his contemporaries. Instead, he uses characters from ancient times, like Alexander the Great, for commentaries about politics. But most often, he uses persons who go one or two generations back. There was a more oral tradition, so recent history was more alive then is the case today.


## Florence in the 13th century
During the time of Dante, Florence was a densely populated city surrounded by a wall. Life was primarily lived outdoors, and the citizens knew each other's faces; essentially, you lived your life closer to your neighbors than nowadays. The old aristocracy disliked the newly rich, and disputes between people often started over some minor public dispute. Contemporary chronicles tell us that factionalism in Florence began in 1215 when a bridegroom snubbed a bride for a better offer. This public insult was answered by the killing of the bridegroom. The bad blood lasted into Dante's time and was usually kept alive by the struggle for political power. Moreover, Florence was an independent city-state (Italy was not unified until the 19th century). Florence, like other city-states, was usually in a perpetual struggle of varying intensity with its neighboring city-states.

## The Guelphs and the Ghibellines
In the early 12th century, the two dominant factors in Florence (and the rest of medieval Italy) were the Guelphs and the Ghibellines. The Ghibellines were the minority in Florence but were the dominant political power in the intercity state south of Florence, Siena. Florence allied with Siena, and there was a battle between the two factions in which the Ghibellines won with the help of Siena. The Ghibellines then took over the political power in Florence, but since the Guelphs were still in the majority, they regained control after a few years. They actually expelled the Ghibellines from the city, and now the Guelphs were the only political power of note in Florence. However, this led to what always happens when a political party gets too powerful: internal conflicts start. This internal strife emerged as two distinct factions: the Blacks and the Whites. Dante was born into the Black faction, so this was the political status during the time of Dante. Now both of these factions sought external political help to gain leverage. They both sought help from the papacy. The papacy decided to help the Whites and sent its army to expel the Blacks. This is the direct reason for Dante being expelled from the city. We must keep this in mind when we read about the people Dante meets in the afterlife.

## Politics in Italy by the time of Dante
Let's explore the political landscape of Europe during Dante's era, which was considered the global stage at the time. In the early medieval period, the papacy had not yet solidified into a formidable political force; it was more akin to a traditional institution. However, by the 11th century, tensions had escalated between the papacy and the emperor. In Florence, factions sought alliances with external powers to bolster their influence. Ghibellines where aligning with the emperor, while the Guelphs were favoring the papacy. The concept of an emperor was firmly established with Charlemagne the Great and became a significant element of European politics by the 11th century.

By Dante's time, these political conflicts had evolved dramatically. Italy was split into three distinct regions: Northern Italy was a patchwork of city-states, with Florence as a prominent member; the central region was governed by the Papal States, which exerted limited political influence over the surrounding areas; and the southern region fell under the rule of King Frederick, who also held the title of Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. Although the Holy Roman Empire did not exercise direct control over the northern city-states, they were considered part of the empire administratively.

Frederick sought to extend his influence and assert actual political authority over these northern city-states, setting him on a collision course with the papacy. This conflict positioned the papacy in a precarious situation, effectively encircled by the Holy Roman Empire's territories.

The political landscape of Dante's era was characterized by shifting alliances, power struggles, and territorial disputes. The interplay between the papacy, the Holy Roman Empire, and the city-states of Italy created a complex web of political relationships that influenced Dante's work and his views on governance, justice, and morality.

## A timeless story 

Dante's Divine Comedy is full of political, social, and religious commentary woven into the story. It provides a backdrop against which Dante's exploration of sin, redemption, and divine justice. Through his encounters with historical and mythological figures, Dante wants readers to reflect on human nature, the consequences of moral choices, and the enduring power of faith and love. In this way, Dante's Divine Comedy continues to engage readers even today, reflecting on the human condition and the eternal quest for meaning.
