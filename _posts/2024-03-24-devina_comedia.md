# Devina Comedia

## Intro
Much of the book is about Dante going to the afterlife and meating a hole lot of people. While doing so he does much of political commentary.
Which people do Dante meat? Most of the people many of us have never heard of. Not even scholars. But one requirement is that the person has died before 1300.
Besides that, there seems to be no restrictions, even fictional characters apears, like Aneas from Virgil. But a lot of them are very famous, even i our time.
Important for us to understand the poem is to be a bit familiar with the characters appearing which are contemporary with Dante (but of course has passed away) who lived in Florens or there about. These charachterst are for the most part not know to most of us today.

When Dante wants to talk about politics and life in Florence he mostly cannot use politicans and other famous people since he started writing the poem when he was 35 years old and therefore hasn't "outlived" his contemporarys oftenly. Instead he uses characters from ancients times, like Alexander the great, for commentaries about... But most often he uses persons which goes one or two genereations back. There was a more oral tradition so resent history was more alive and persons more well known then perhaps our politicans from one or two genereations back.


## Florence
During the time of Dante Florence was a densly populated city surrounded by a wall.  Life was primarily lived outdoors and the citizens knew each others faces, basically you lived your life closer to your neighbours then nowdays.  The old aristocrate disliked the new rich, and disputes between people oftently started by som minor public dispute. Contemporary chronicles tells that facionalism in Florence started 1215 by a bridgrom snupping of a bride for a better offer. This public insult was answered by the killing of the bridegroom. The bad blood lasted into Dantes time and was usually held much alive by the struggle for political power. Moreover, Florence was an independent city state (Italay was not of course unified until the 19th century). Florence, like other city states, usually was in a perpetual struggle of varying intensity with its neighbouring citystates.


## Florence in the time of Dante
In the early 12th century the two dominant factors in Florence where the guelph's and the gibbelins. the gibbelins the minority in Florence but where was the dominant political power Intercity state south of Florence Sienna. Florence allied with Sienna and there was a battle between the two factions in which two giblin's one with the help of Siena. that gibbelins took over the political power in Florence but since the quilts were still in majority they took over again after a few years. they actually kicked the gibbelins out of the city and now the gloves where the only political power to speak of in Florence. however this led to what always happens when it political party gets a little bigger internal fight start. this internal fight emerged as two distinct factions the blacks and the whites. Dunton was born into the black faction so this is the political status in the time of Santa. now both of these faction sort external political help 2 get Leverage. they both sought help from the papacy. the papacy decides to help the whites and sends his army to expel the blacks. this is that direct reason for Thunder being expelled from the city. we must have this in mind when we read about the people down to meet in the afterlife.

## Politics
let's take a look at the global political stage at the time of Don Cheto. Or at least Global in Europe. early Medieval Times capacity had not emerge yet as strong political power it was more like a tradition however by the 11th century it was in conflict with the emperor. different factions in Florence turn to different external actors to seek support . those who sought to support of the emperor were called I don't know and those who sought to support from the papacy we're called I don't know. the emperor had first emerged as Charlemagne the Great and by the 11th century I believe. by the time of Tonka this political struggle to an important turn. Italy was divided into three parts the upper Italy consisted of the city-states among which Florence was one of the most important the middle part was the papacy which had not real political power over this area. There was no other Regency in this area. However the southern part was ruled by a king Fredrik. what happened was that Fredrik who was elected emperor of the Roman Empire or the Holy Roman Empire. the Holy Roman Empire did not have direct political power over the city-state's of the northern part of Italy but it kind of administratively belong to the Holy Roman Empire. no Friedrich thought that he would actually like real political power over the northern city-states. this put Fredrik on that Direct conflicting path against the papacy. The papacy would now be surrounded by the Roman Empire.
